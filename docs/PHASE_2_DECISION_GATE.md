# Phase 2 Decision Gate

**Date:** 2025-01-28  
**Status:** ⏳ **AWAITING PHASE 1 VALIDATION**

---

## Decision Criteria

**Phase 2 Trigger:** Clarity is consistently achieved (validated with users)

### Validation Requirements

**Primary Metric:**
- ✅ Users understand "what to do next" within 60 seconds
- ✅ No questions about multi-agent systems, automation, or workflows
- ✅ User feels less overwhelmed (qualitative feedback)

**Sample Size:**
- Minimum 3-5 first-time users
- Minimum 3-5 returning users
- Consistent clarity across all test users

---

## If Clarity Proven ✅

### Phase 2: Organization Layer

**Goal:** Layer organization features after clarity is established.

**Potential Features:**
- Workflows list (show all plans, not just next action)
- Workflow history (past actions completed)
- Project organization (group related actions)
- Search/filter capabilities

**Design Principles:**
- Maintain clarity-first approach
- Add organization without overwhelming
- Keep next action prominent
- Layer gradually (not all at once)

### Phase 3: Inspiration Layer

**Goal:** Layer inspiration features after organization is proven.

**Potential Features:**
- Workflow suggestions (based on context)
- Example prompts/questions
- Success stories/case studies
- Creative prompts library

**Design Principles:**
- Inspire without overwhelming
- Maintain clarity and organization
- Suggest, don't require
- Keep next action primary

### Phase 4: Assistance Layer

**Goal:** Layer assistance features after inspiration is proven.

**Potential Features:**
- Multi-agent system (Giorgio, Cassidy, Jamal, Letitia)
- Automation (auto-suggestions, auto-delegation)
- Advanced features (file upload, complex workflows)
- Analytics and insights

**Design Principles:**
- Assist without overwhelming
- Maintain clarity, organization, and inspiration
- Power features for advanced users
- Keep next action accessible

## If Clarity Not Proven ❌

### Remediation Steps

1. **Simplify Further**
   - Remove any remaining complexity
   - Reduce cognitive load
   - Focus even more on single action

2. **Adjust Copy/Language**
   - Test different wording
   - Improve constraint cues
   - Clarify instructions

3. **Improve Next-Action Logic**
   - Ensure responses are truly "one clear action"
   - Test different response formats
   - Validate action clarity

4. **Re-Test**
   - Run validation again
   - Measure improvement
   - Iterate until clarity achieved

## Decision Process

### Step 1: Validation Results
- Collect all validation data
- Analyze success metrics
- Identify patterns/issues

### Step 2: Decision Meeting
- Review validation results
- Assess clarity achievement
- Make go/no-go decision

### Step 3: Action Plan
- **If Go:** Define Phase 2 trigger criteria and plan organization layer
- **If No-Go:** Remediate and re-validate

## Phase 2 Trigger Definition (To Be Completed After Validation)

**Status:** ⏳ **AWAITING VALIDATION RESULTS**

Once clarity is proven, define:
- Exact trigger criteria
- Phase 2 feature set
- Implementation plan
- Success metrics for Phase 2

---

**Current Status:** Phase 1 complete, awaiting validation results before defining Phase 2 trigger.
