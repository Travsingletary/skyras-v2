**Date:** 2025-01-28  
**Status:** 🔒 **LOCKED - No Changes Unless User Validation Contradicts**

---

## Locked Copy

**Headline:** "Let's assist you in creating."  
**Subline:** "One clear next action. No overwhelm."  
**Prompt:** "What are you working on right now?"  
**Constraint Cue:** "We focus on one step at a time so you can move forward with clarity."  
**Login Prompt:** "Want to keep this organized and continue from here next time?"

## Pressure Test Results

**Status:** ✅ **PASSED**

**Tested Personas:**
- ✅ Focused Professional - PASS (efficient, respectful)
- ✅ Overloaded Creative - PASS (relieving, non-labeling)
- ✅ Curious Newcomer - PASS (broad, low-risk)

**Conclusion:**
- Works for focused professionals, overloaded creatives, and curious newcomers
- Broad without being vague
- Reduces overwhelm without assuming a "stuck" state

---

## Directive

**Do NOT change entry copy unless real user validation contradicts it.**

**Allowed Changes:**
- Only if real user validation shows copy doesn't work
- Must have evidence from actual user testing
- Copy changes must be minimal and preserve clarity

**Not Allowed:**
- Changes based on assumptions or preferences
- Changes without user validation evidence
- Changes that compromise clarity constraint

---

## Primary Remaining Phase 1 Risk

**Output Quality:** Next-action output must always be concrete, specific, and small.

**Validation Focus:**
- Evaluate whether users consistently receive an actionable next step they can immediately do
- Not advice or reflection
- Not vague suggestions
- Not multi-step plans

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Output is concrete (specific action, not abstract)
- ✅ Output is specific (clear what to do, not general)
- ✅ Output is small (one step, not multiple)
- ✅ Output is immediately actionable (can do it now, not later)
