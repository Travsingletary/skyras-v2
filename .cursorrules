## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The system implements a specialized multi-agent AI orchestration platform for creative content generation and management, centered around five core business domains:

## AI Agent Orchestration System (85/100)
Central coordination system managing specialized AI agents:
- Giorgio: Creative content generation agent
- Cassidy: Compliance validation agent  
- Jamal: Distribution management agent
- Letitia: Content cataloging agent
- Marcus: Overall workflow orchestration

Implements real-time agent delegation, task coordination and asynchronous workflow execution with full state tracking.

## Voice Processing Pipeline (80/100)
Bidirectional voice communication system mapping specific voices to different AI agents:
- Speech-to-text with noise handling
- Text-to-speech with agent voice mapping
- Voice queue management
- Custom text optimization for TTS

## Workflow Management (85/100)
Complex task orchestration system handling:
- Task dependency resolution
- Real-time execution monitoring
- Priority-based scheduling
- Status-based progression
- Agent-specific assignment rules

## Media Generation Control (75/100) 
Custom video generation pipeline supporting:
- Aspect ratio optimization
- Multi-model content generation
- Queue management
- Failure recovery
- Runway ML integration

## Compliance Scanning (70/100)
Automated validation system for:
- Licensing verification
- Project compliance rules
- Multi-file batch processing
- Regulatory requirement checking

The core business value centers on the orchestration of specialized AI agents working together to handle content creation, compliance, distribution and cataloging through sophisticated task delegation and workflow management.
