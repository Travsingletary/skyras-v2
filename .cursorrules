## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The system implements a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration platform for content creation and management, organized into six core business domains:

1. Agent Orchestration System (85/100)
- Atlas serves as primary decision-maker and traffic controller
- Implements agent delegation and state management
- Maintains conversation context and priority management
- Located in: frontend/src/app/api/agents/atlas/route.ts

2. Multi-Agent Workflow System (90/100)
- Orchestrates sequential task execution across specialized agents
- Manages dependencies between creative tasks
- Controls workflow state transitions
- Located in: frontend/src/app/api/workflows/[id]/execute/route.ts

3. Content Generation Pipeline (80/100)
- Multi-modal content generation workflow
- Provider selection and fallback logic
- Generation cost tracking and quota management
- Located in: frontend/src/app/api/tools/generateImage/route.ts

4. File Processing Pipeline (75/100)
- Intelligent file type detection and routing
- Automated workflow suggestions
- Processing record management
- Located in: frontend/src/app/api/upload/route.ts

5. Agent Compliance System (85/100)
- Content licensing validation
- Policy enforcement and scanning
- Violation tracking and reporting
- Located in: frontend/src/app/api/agents/compliance/scan/route.ts

6. Task Management System (80/100)
- Task delegation and execution orchestration
- Dependency management and scheduling
- State transition control
- Located in: frontend/src/app/api/workflows/tasks/[taskId]/route.ts

The system uses a "Single Mouthpiece" pattern where Atlas coordinates specialized worker agents (Giorgio, Jamal, Letitia, Cassidy) while maintaining unified interaction patterns.

Core integration points:
- Agent coordination and task routing
- Workflow generation and execution
- Content processing and validation
- Multi-modal asset generation
