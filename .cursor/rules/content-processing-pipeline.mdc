The content processing pipeline implements specialized handling for multi-modal content across different file types and workflows.

Core Components:

1. File Type Detection & Routing (Importance: 85/100)
- Sophisticated content type analysis system that examines file metadata and contents
- Business-specific routing rules that delegate files to specialized AI agents:
  * Video files -> Giorgio for creative enhancement
  * Audio files -> Letitia for cataloging
  * Images -> Cassidy for compliance checking
  * Text -> Jamal for distribution planning

2. Workflow Suggestion Engine (Importance: 80/100)
- Analyzes incoming content characteristics to generate optimal processing workflows
- Maps content attributes to specialized agent capabilities
- Generates dependency chains for multi-stage content processing
- Implements business rules for content enhancement opportunities

3. Processing Rules System (Importance: 75/100)
- Maintains provider-specific processing requirements for different content types:
  * Video: Aspect ratio optimization, thumbnail generation
  * Audio: Background noise reduction, voice enhancement
  * Images: Style consistency checks, brand alignment
  * Text: Tone analysis, platform-specific formatting

4. Processing Queue Management (Importance: 70/100)
- Prioritizes content processing based on:
  * Content type urgency rules
  * Dependencies between processing stages
  * Agent availability and specialization
  * Project deadline requirements

5. Automated Content Enhancement (Importance: 85/100)
- Implements specialized enhancement workflows:
  * Educational content adaptation
  * Brand consistency enforcement
