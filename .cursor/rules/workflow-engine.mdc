## Core Engine Components (Importance: 90/100)

1. Task Dependency Resolution
- Complex workflow dependency resolution system
- Cycle detection in task dependencies
- Task readiness calculation based on parent/child relationships
- Dependency chain tracking with state validation
Location: frontend/src/lib/taskDependencies.ts

2. Auto-Execution Orchestration (Importance: 85/100)
- Intelligent workflow creation from agent delegations
- Multi-agent task routing based on capabilities
- Parallel execution management with dependency constraints
- State machine implementation for task progression
Location: frontend/src/lib/autoExecute.ts

3. Agent Task Processing (Importance: 85/100)
- Multi-agent orchestration system with specialized roles:
  * Giorgio: Creative content generation
  * Cassidy: Compliance checking
  * Jamal: Distribution management
  * Letitia: Content cataloging
- Real-time task delegation and coordination
- State tracking across asynchronous workflow execution
Location: frontend/src/app/studio/page.tsx

4. Workflow State Management (Importance: 80/100)
- Priority-based task scheduling system
- Status-based workflow progression logic
- Agent-specific task assignment rules
- Real-time execution monitoring
Location: frontend/src/app/workflows/[id]/page.tsx

5. Delegation Handler (Importance: 75/100)
- Cross-agent task delegation system 
- Delegation chain tracking
- Parent-child task relationship management
- Task context propagation
Location: frontend/src/lib/delegationHandler.ts

The workflow engine represents a sophisticated orchestration system focused on managing complex task dependencies between specialized AI agents while maintaining state consistency and proper execution order across asynchronous operations.
