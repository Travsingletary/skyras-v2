# workflow-engine

Core workflow engine components orchestrate task execution, manage dependencies, and automate workflows across specialized AI agents:

## Task Dependency System
Importance Score: 90/100

Located in `frontend/lib/taskDependencies.ts`:
- Manages complex task relationship graphs
- Resolves circular dependencies through topological sorting
- Tracks task readiness through prerequisite completion
- Maintains execution order based on dependencies
- Handles parallel execution of independent task branches

## Auto-Execution Engine
Importance Score: 85/100

Located in `frontend/lib/autoExecute.ts`:
- Orchestrates automated task delegation across agents
- Implements task queueing and prioritization
- Manages parallel execution based on agent availability
- Handles task completion notifications and state updates
- Maintains workflow context across multiple agents

## State Machine Implementation
Importance Score: 80/100

Located in `frontend/lib/workflow/stateMachine.ts`:
- Defines workflow states: PENDING, RUNNING, PAUSED, COMPLETED, FAILED
- Manages state transitions with validation rules
- Implements rollback capabilities for failed states
- Tracks partial completion states for complex workflows
- Maintains audit trail of state changes

## Task Distribution System
Importance Score: 85/100

Located in `frontend/lib/workflow/taskDistributor.ts`:
- Routes tasks to specialized agents (Giorgio, Jamal, Letitia, Cassidy)
- Implements load balancing across available agents
- Manages agent-specific task queues
- Handles task timeout and retry logic
- Maintains agent availability status

## Workflow Templates
Importance Score: 75/100

Located in `frontend/lib/workflow/templates/`:
- Defines reusable workflow patterns for common tasks
- Implements template substitution for dynamic workflows
- Manages template versioning and compatibility
- Provides customization points for workflow adaptation
- Maintains template validation rules
