## Core Generation Pipeline (Importance: 90/100)

Content generation system orchestrates multi-modal creative workflows through specialized AI agents and providers:

1. Creative Brief Processing
- Parses creative requirements into structured generation tasks
- Maps business goals to specific content types
- Generates technical specifications for each creative asset
- Routes to appropriate specialized generation agents

2. Multi-Modal Generation Orchestration
- Coordinates parallel generation across content types
- Manages dependencies between generated assets
- Enforces style consistency across modalities
- Handles provider fallbacks and retries

## Provider Integration System (Importance: 85/100)

Implements provider abstraction and routing for content generation:

1. Image Generation Router
- Prioritized fallback between Runway and Stable Diffusion
- Provider-specific prompt engineering
- Style consistency enforcement
- Cost and quota management

2. Video Generation Pipeline 
- Scene composition and sequencing
- Asset integration and timing
- Provider-specific format handling
- Quality validation and regeneration

## Creative Agent System (Importance: 85/100)

Giorgio creative agent implements specialized generation logic:

1. Creative Task Analysis
- Decomposes requirements into generation steps
- Maps creative goals to technical parameters
- Validates generation feasibility
- Estimates resource requirements

2. Generation Orchestration
- Manages multi-stage creative workflows
- Coordinates between generation services
- Validates creative output quality
- Handles regeneration and refinement
