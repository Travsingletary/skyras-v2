# agent-orchestration-system

The agent orchestration system implements a sophisticated multi-agent workflow with specialized AI agents:

## Core Agents and Roles (Importance: 90/100)
- Marcus: Central orchestrator and decision maker
- Giorgio: Creative content generation specialist 
- Cassidy: Compliance validation and checking
- Jamal: Content distribution management
- Letitia: Content cataloging and organization

## Delegation System (Importance: 85/100)
Location: frontend/lib/delegationHandler.ts
- Cross-agent task delegation based on agent capabilities
- Parent-child task relationship tracking
- Delegation chain monitoring
- Task context propagation with metadata

## Task Dependencies (Importance: 80/100)
Location: frontend/lib/taskDependencies.ts
- Complex workflow dependency resolution
- Cycle detection in task dependencies
- Task readiness calculation
- Parallel task execution constraints

## Agent Communication Flow (Importance: 85/100)
Location: frontend/lib/agentProcessor.ts
- Task context enrichment between agents
- File metadata integration
- Response formatting and standardization
- Inter-agent messaging protocols

## Marcus Decision System (Importance: 90/100)
Location: frontend/agents/marcus/marcusAgent.ts
- Task routing based on content analysis
- User preference integration
- Context-aware response generation
- Project-specific execution strategies

Key Integration Points:
1. Creative task delegation to Giorgio
2. Compliance verification routing to Cassidy
3. Distribution planning through Jamal
4. Content organization via Letitia

The system's uniqueness lies in its specialized agent roles and sophisticated task orchestration, enabling complex creative workflows through coordinated agent interactions.
