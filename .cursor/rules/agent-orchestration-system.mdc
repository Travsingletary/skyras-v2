Agent Orchestration Core (Importance: 90/100)
- Atlas serves as central coordinator for specialized agent team
- Task delegation via keyword/context analysis to specialized agents:
  - Marcus: Project management and task breakdown
  - Giorgio: Creative content generation
  - Cassidy: Compliance and licensing
  - Jamal: Content distribution
  - Letitia: Asset cataloging and management
- Single-priority focus with strict task ordering
- Maintains conversation context across agent handoffs

Task Delegation System (Importance: 85/100)
/frontend/src/lib/autoExecute.ts
- Automated workflow creation from agent delegations 
- Task dependency resolution for parallel execution
- Intelligent routing based on agent specializations
- Context preservation during handoffs
- Fallback delegation patterns for agent unavailability

Agent Communication Flows (Importance: 80/100)
/frontend/src/agents/marcus/marcusAgent.ts
- "Single Mouthpiece" pattern with Atlas as primary coordinator
- Contextual intelligence for routing decisions
- Task queue management per agent
- State synchronization between agents
- Bounded context maintenance during delegation

Workflow Orchestration (Importance: 85/100)
/frontend/src/app/api/workflows/[id]/execute/route.ts
- Sequential task execution across agent network
- Dependency management between agent tasks
- State transitions and completion tracking
- Parallel execution coordination
- Workflow suggestion generation

Primary Implementation Patterns:
1. Centralized coordination through Atlas
2. Specialized agent roles with clear boundaries
3. Context-aware task routing
4. Single-priority task management
5. Automated workflow generation
