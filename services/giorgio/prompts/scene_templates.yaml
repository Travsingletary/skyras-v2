      lyrics: |
        Sometimes I hide, afraid to say,
        The truth I kept just fades away.
        But when I'm real, the light comes through,
        The sky shines brighter — me and you.
        
        Shine with the truth, let your light show,
        When you're honest, that's when you glow.
        No need to hide, no need to fear,
        The truth will always bring us near.
